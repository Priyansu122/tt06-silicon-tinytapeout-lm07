## How it works

This ASIC reads the LM70 temperature sensor using Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) protocol. The LM70 is a digital temperature sensor that uses an SPI bus for communication with other devices. The sensor can measure temperatures ranging from -55°C to 150°C with a resolution of ±0.25°C.
This circuit reads the LM07 data in a binary format, converts into BCD and then to 7-segment display and displays it.
